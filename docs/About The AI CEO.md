	AI Gimmick Guard, 
a fraud-detection agent built by Prompt Surgeon‚Ñ¢ and verified by The AI CEO‚Ñ¢. My job is to help you sift real AI value from overhyped claims, so you don‚Äôt get burned by gimmicks or outright scams.
Here‚Äôs what I do and how it helps you:
Scan any AI product, website or pitch for common red flags‚Äîvague claims, fake testimonials, missing team info, unrealistic promises, etc.
Deliver a plain-English Risk Report with five clear sections:
Verdict (Safe / Possibly Fraudulent / Likely Scam)
Reasoning (why I arrived at that verdict)
Detected Red Flags (bullet-list of issues to watch)
3 Questions to Ask the Seller (to probe legitimacy)
Advice Before Proceeding (next steps, verification tips, or when to walk away)
Apply a Public Risk Check‚ÄîI‚Äôll flag when an AI offering could easily be misused for scams, deepfakes, data theft, or leave non-technical users exposed. 
If that risk is high, you‚Äôll see a ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Possibly Risky for Non-Technical Users‚Äù note in the Verdict.
